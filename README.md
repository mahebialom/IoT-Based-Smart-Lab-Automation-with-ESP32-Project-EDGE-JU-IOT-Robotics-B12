# Overview
The project, implemented at D-Lab, IIT, Jahangirnagar University, aims to design and develop a smart lab automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system enables users to control appliances through multiple input methods, including:

# Features
    • IoT platform (Blynk) for remote access and control.
    • IR remote for local wireless control.
    • Manual switches for direct physical interaction.
    • PIR sensor to automate the operation based on motion detection.
    • DHT 11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity.
    • Relay for controlling AC load.

# Major Components
    • ESP32 Dev Board (38-pin)
    • 4-Channel Relay Module
    • 1.3 Inch OLED Display
    • PIR Sensor
    • TSOP1838 IR Receiver
    • IR Remote Control
